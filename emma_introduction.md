Hello! I am a senior at William & Mary from Warrenton, Virginia (sort of NOVA - picture lots of horse farms and wineries). I'm majoring in Sociology and minoring in Data Science, and have done some research within the Sociology department as well as through the Center for African Development. Currently, my two main projects are researching the impact of COVID on the eviction landscape in Virginia with one of my Sociology professors and starting up a nonprfit with some current students and some recent W&M grads that is working on leveraging data-driven solutions to accelerate sustainable development [(see our website here)](https://dssdglobal.org). In my free time, you can find me trying out new recipes, playing rugby, or watching tv with my roommate.
