Hello! I am a senior at William & Mary from Warrenton, Virginia (sort of NOVA - picture lots of horse farms and wineries). I'm majoring in Sociology and minoring in Data Science, and enjoy blending the two to seek creative, data-driven solutions to the issues of our time. To that end, I'm working with some current W&M students and some recent W&M grads to start a nonprofit that is working to leverage data-driven solutions to accelerate sustainable development [(see our website here)](https://dssdglobal.org). In my free time, you can find me trying out new recipes, playing rugby, or watching tv with my roommate.
