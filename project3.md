# Project 3

### Using two machine learning methods predict population values at 100 x 100 meter resolution throughout your selected country


### Validate the two models using different methods presented in this class


### Write a report assessing the two approaches and which of the two models was more accurate. Be sure to account for spatial variation throughout your selected location and provide substantive explanations for why those variations occurred.
